#####  Installing Percona Toolkit  #####

https://docs.percona.com/percona-toolkit/installation.html

gesti@gestitest:~$ sudo apt-get install percona-toolkit

Generating an instance UUID for statistics

During the installation process, the percona-toolkit installer records a unique identifier specific to the given percona-toolkit instance. This ID is a the product UUID stored in /sys/class/dmi/id/product_uuid. The installer copies the product_uuid to /etc/percona-toolkit/.percona.toolkit.uuid.

This unique identifier is used when collecting statistics about the usage of percona-toolkit. Note that no other information is gathered for this purpose.

In cases when the installer is not able to read the contents of /sys/class/dmi/id/product_uuid, a random UUID is generated. A random UUID is also generated if percona-toolkit is run from the binary in the tar.gz file.
